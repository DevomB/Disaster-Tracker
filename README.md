# Disaster Tracker

Disaster Tracker is a real-time emergency response app designed to keep people informed and prepared during natural disasters. The app was inspired by the devastating impact of Hurricane Helene, which hit close to home when I lost a family member due to the lack of timely information and preparedness. With this project, we hope to prevent others from facing similar tragedies by providing them with the resources they need when it matters most.

## Features

- **Emergency resources:** Access critical contacts and survival tips.

## Features
